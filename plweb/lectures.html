- Week 10: 10/14 - 10/18
  - M: Type Safety: Well Typed Programs Don't Go Wrong!
    - MiniOCaml: Add a small step semantics with arbitrary recursion.
    - Topics: A very important property of a PL.    
  - W: Abstract Machines
    - Topics: Specifying and implementing the evaluation programs.  We will define an abstract machine for miniOCaml.      
  - Homework 4: TBA

---

- Week 11: 10/21 - 10/25
  - M: Progress: Characterizing the values of a PL
    - Topics: An important property regarding evaluation of programs.
  - W: Parametric Polymorphism (Generics)
    - Topics: The definition of polymorphism or commonly called
      generics will be discussed. We will add polymorphism to
      miniOCaml as an example. 
  - Project: Meeting Due Date

---

- Week 12: 10/28 - 11/01
  - M: Data Abstraction: The first step to object orientation.
    - Topics: The use of existential types to hide data in a type safe
      way is discussed.  We will add existential types to miniOCaml as
      an example.  
  - W: Organizing Programs using Records: The second step to object orientation.
    - Topics: We move a bit closer to OOP by introducing records.  A
      simple way to organize the structure of programs and data.  We
      will add records to miniOCaml as an example.       
    
---

- Week 13: 11/4 - 11/8
  - M: Mutable Storage: State is the third step to object orientation.
    - Topics: Two types of mutable storage designs are discussed: the
      imperative style where types do not track effects, but the
      evaluation rules have to track storage, and the type-based
      design were types track all effects, but the evaluation remains
      pure.  We add imperative style effects to miniOCaml as an
      example, and show that the other style can also be used in
      miniOCaml.  
  - W: Object Orientation: Part I
    - Topics: We show that the combination of data abstract, records,
      and mutable storage results in the ability to define classes and
      objects.            

---

- Week 14: 11/11 - 11/15
  - M: Object Orientation: Part II
    - Topics: We add subtyping to the mix to gain a surprising amount
      of power and expressivity for object-oriented programming.  We
      add subtyping to MiniOCaml as an example.  
  - W: Storage Management and Garbage Collection
    - Topics: We discuss two important parts of many modern
      programming languages: storage management and garbage collection.
  - Project: Midpoint Report Due
  
---

- Week 15: 11/18 - 11/22
  - M: Evaluation Orders and Futures
    - Topics: We discuss the various evaluation orders, introduce
      call-by-need, and then futures.  We show how we would modify
miniOCaml to support call-by-need.
  - W: Resource Typing: A new approach for catching common bugs.
    - Topics: We talk about how advances in type systems can be used
      to catch some of the most common programmer mistakes. These have
      lead to new languages like Rust, Swift, and new additions to
      Java Script. We add resource typing to miniOCaml as an example. 

---

- Week 16: 11/25 - 11/29
  - M: Resource Typing: A new approach for catching common bugs.
    - Topics: We talk about how advances in type systems can be used
      to catch some of the most common programmer mistakes. These have
      lead to new languages like Rust, Swift, and new additions to
      Java Script. We add resource typing to miniOCaml as an example. 
  - W: No Class (Thanksgiving Break)
    
---

- Week 17: 12/2 - 12/6
  - M: No Class (Project Week)
  - W: No Class (Project Week)
  
---

- Week 18: 12/9 - 12/13
  - T (12/10): Project Presentations (Final Exam)
