<ul>
<li>T: Parametric Polymorphism (Generics)
<ul>
<li>Topics: The definition of polymorphism or commonly called generics will be discussed. We will add polymorphism to miniOCaml as an example.</li>
<li>R: Data Abstraction: The first step to object orientation.
<ul>
<li>Topics: The use of existential types to hide data in a type safe way is discussed. We will add existential types to miniOCaml as an example.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>T: Organizing Programs using Records: The second step to object orientation.
<ul>
<li><p>Topics: We move a bit closer to OOP by introducing records. A simple way to organize the structure of programs and data. We will add records to miniOCaml as an example.</p></li>
<li><p>R: Mutable Storage: State is the third step to object orientation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics: Two types of mutable storage designs are discussed: the imperative style where types do not track effects, but the evaluation rules have to track storage, and the type-based design were types track all effects, but the evaluation remains pure. We add imperative style effects to miniOCaml as an example, and show that the other style can also be used in miniOCaml.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>T: Object Orientation: Part I
<ul>
<li>Topics: We show that the combination of data abstract, records, and mutable storage results in the ability to define classes and objects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Object Orientation: Part II - Topics: We add subtyping to the mix to gain a surprising amount of power and expressivity for object-oriented programming. We add subtyping to MiniOCaml as an example.</p>
<p>Storage Management and Garbage Collection - Topics: We discuss two important parts of many modern programming languages: storage management and garbage collection.</p>
<p>Evaluation Orders and Futures - Topics: We discuss the various evaluation orders, introduce call-by-need, and then futures. We show how we would modify miniOCaml to support call-by-need.</p>
<p>Resource Typing: A new approach for catching common bugs. - Topics: We talk about how advances in type systems can be used to catch some of the most common programmer mistakes. These have lead to new languages like Rust, Swift, and new additions to Java Script. We add resource typing to miniOCaml as an example.</p>
