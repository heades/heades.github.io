<h1 id="installing-vs-code.">Installing VS Code.</h1>
<p>I recommend using VS Code as your editor, and I’m able to assist you
with that if you run into trouble. You can use whatever editor you like,
but I will not be able to support other editors.</p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code
Download Page</a>. Install it! I highly recommend also installing the
command-line <code>code</code> command to open files from the command
line. Follow these steps to do that:</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>⇧⌘P</kbd> to open the Command Palette.</li>
<li>Type <code>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH</code> and
select it.</li>
<li>Restart your terminal.</li>
<li>Use <code>code PATH_TO_FILE_OR_FOLDER</code> to open VS Code from
the terminal.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Windows (WSL)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Command Palette.</li>
<li>Type <code>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH</code> and
select it.</li>
<li>Restart the terminal.</li>
<li>Use <code>code PATH_TO_FILE_OR_FOLDER</code> in your WSL terminal to
open VS Code.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Command Palette.</li>
<li>Type <code>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH</code> and

</ol>
<h1 id="installing-and-using-git">Installing and using Git</h1>
<p>In this course you will be assigned a Git source-code repository (or
repo for short) that you will use to turn in all assignments.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-git">What is Git?</h2>
<p>Git is a textfile revision system. One uses it to manage revisions of
text files between multiple people using a single set of files. Git will
keep track of who made which changes and when (the revision history),
provide tools for undoing and redoing changes (handling merging), allow
remote access to the repository, and even support multiple time lines of
the files (branching).</p>
<p>In this short tutorial I’ll go through everything you need to know in
order to use Git in this course.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-git-and-github">The difference between
Git and Github</h2>
<p>Git is a command-line tool that is installed on your computer to
manage Git repositories of textfiles. When using Git on your computer
the repositories are local, but Git has the ability to share them
remotely with others. This is where Github comes in.</p>
<p>Github is a hosting site for Git repositories. If you want to share
your repo with a team of other people then you can host it on Github and
allow others to subscribe to it. Github allows them be able to download
your repositories, change it, and even submit changes back to the
repository on Github for you to have as well.</p>
<h2 id="installing-git">Installing Git</h2>
<p>First we need to get Git on your computer if it’s not there already.
If you are running Linux, you are done, and can skip this section.
Otherwise, Mac OS X users need only open the Terminal app, and type
<code>git</code> at the command line. If Git’s not install already, then
it will tell you what you need to do.</p>
<p>So if you’re a Windows user, then please install Git by opening the
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) terminal, and run the commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install git</code></pre>
<p>Then test that it is installed by running:</p>
<pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
<p>You should see an output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>git version 2.39.5</code></pre>
<p>If not, then something went wrong. Now that Git is installed please
move on to setting it up.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-git">Setting up Git</h2>
<p>We now need to setup Git on your computer so that it knows who you
are. This is independent of your Github username and email, and is
setting up your local Git install to record your name and email when
telling Git about your revisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your name:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git config --global user.name &quot;John Doe&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Replace “John Doe” with your full name. This is the name Git will use
to record your changes in the revision history.</p></li>
<li><p>Your email:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git config --global user.email jdoe@augusta.edu</code></pre>
<p>The revision history also records your email. Set this to your AU
email address.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ssh-keys-for-github">Setting up SSH Keys for
Github</h2>
<p>Github has disabled username and password authentication when working
with your git repositories. Following these directions to setup SSH-key
authentication on your Github account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate a new SSH key on your system (do this in WSL): <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Directions</a></li>
<li>Add the newly generate key to your Github account: <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">Directions</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloning-your-repo">Cloning your repo</h2>
<p><strong>At this point you have emailed me with your</strong>
<strong><a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> login and I have
replied with the</strong> <strong>link to your Git repo. If not, then
please do this step first.</strong></p>
<p>Now we will <strong>clone</strong> your repo that I have created for
you, and that is hosted on Github, to your computer so that you can use
it.</p>
<p>First create a folder on your computer that you will use to keep
everything in this class in. I’ll call it <code>pl_dir</code> in this
tutorial. Then open the command line and navigate to
<code>pl_dir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir</code></pre>
<p>At this point you have changed your working directory to
<code>pl_dir</code>. You can check that this worked by running the
command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pwd</code></pre>
<p>This stands for “present working directory”.</p>
<p>Now that your working directory is <code>pl_dir</code> we can clone
your course repository using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone URL</code></pre>
<p>replace <code>URL</code> with the URL I sent you.</p>
<p>Now check to make sure that the clone was successful (if it weren’t
you should have gotten an error message):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls </code></pre>
<p>This command is “list files” and simply lists all the files in your
working directory. If you see your repo, then you are good to go.
Otherwise an error happened, and so try again, but if you can’t figure
it out, then ask on Slack.</p>
<p>You only ever need to clone a repository once. Unless you delete the
folder you will never have to clone this repository again.</p>
<h2 id="editing-files-in-your-repo">Editing files in your repo</h2>
<p>A Git repo is just a special directory that Git knows about. Once
it’s cloned to your computer you can treat it as a standard folder on
your computer that is full of textfiles that are managed by Git. The
only time you need to use the command line or Git is when you are ready
to tell Git about the changes you’ve made.</p>
<p>So to get an idea of how this works. Using the file explorer (Finder
on Mac OS X) go and take a look at your repo in <code>pl_dir</code>. The
first time you clone your repo it will contain the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git_tutorial</code> : Some example files for this
tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are working on your assignments you can use your computers
graphical based means of exploring files and folders, and simply treat
the files as normal files. Open them with editors and save them,
etc.</p>
<p>Let’s do an example. Open <code>git_tutorial/example.txt</code> in
your favorite text editor. Answer the question and save it.</p>
<p>Now we are going to tell Git about your changes, commit them to the
revision history, and then push them to Github where I can see and get
your changes too.</p>
<p>Open the command line and move into the the <code>git_tutorial</code>
folder:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir/git_tutorial</code></pre>
<p>Now tell Git about your changes by committing them:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git commit -a -m &#39;Answered the question.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This is adds all the changes you’ve made to the files in your working
directory to the revision history. This is a completely local operation,
it doesn’t communicate it to Github.</p>
<p>You can see the revision history using the command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git log</code></pre>
<p>This lists all the changes by everyone who’ve made changes to the
files in your repo. For example, you will see mine listed as well, and I
will see yours. Notice your name and email are showing up, this is the
result of the setup we did earlier.</p>
<p>The command <code>git commit -a -m</code> says you want to commit
each change to the files in my working directory using the commit
message provided; we used <code>'Answered the question'</code>. This
message should be a detailed description of the changes you have made.
As you can see in the revision history when using <code>git log</code>
this shows up in the history. I’ll read these to see what you have
done.</p>
<p>You are now ready to share your changes with Github. To do this,
<strong>push</strong> your changes upstream:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git push</code></pre>
<p>This sends all of your recent commits to Github so that everyone who
subscribes to your repository can get your changes.</p>
<h2 id="fetching-changes-from-github">Fetching changes from Github</h2>
<p>The last Git operation you will need for this course is a means of
fetching or <strong>pulling</strong> recent changes by people other than
you from Github. For example, I’ll be adding your assignments to your
repository throughout the semester, and so, you will need to get them
from Github into your repository.</p>
<p>First, move into your repository:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd path_to_pl_dir/pl_dir</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you have no modified files Git doesn’t know about, because
you have never committed them. Do the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;.

nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
<p>If you see the above message, then you are good to go, all changes
have been committed to your revision history. If you see something that
looks like:</p>
<pre><code>On branch main
Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   markdown/git.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then you have untracked changes that need to be committed. Go back to
the previous section and commit your changes before proceeding. There
can be no non-committed changes when we pull from Github, because Git
will merge all changes together.</p>
<p>To pull all changes from Github into your local repository do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git pull</code></pre>
<p>within your repository. Note that all Git commands must be within
your repository. That is, your present working directory must be your
repository; in this tutorial it has been <code>pl_dir</code>.</p>
<h1 id="docker-and-ocaml">Docker and OCaml</h1>
<p>Now we will install and use Docker to run OCaml.</p>
<h2 id="docker-installation">Docker Installation</h2>
<p>First, regardless of your operating system go and install <a
href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker
Desktop</a>. This will install a graphical interface for docker as well
as the commandline. I will be using the commandline here, and I will
only support the commandline. If you use the graphical interface, then
that’s up to you to figure out.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different installers for Docker. Select the
from the ones below based on your operating system and CPU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows running on Intel and AMD, choose the AMD64.</li>
<li>Windows running on ARM64, choose ARM64.</li>
<li>Mac running on Intel, choose Intel Chip.</li>
<li>Mac running on Apple Silicon, choose Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Linux, choose “Download for Linux”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to open the Docker Desktop to finish installation.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Docker Desktop needs to be running whenever you use
Docker on the</strong> <strong>commandline. If it is closed, the
commands may not work.</strong></p>
<p>After installation, open a terminal (Windows the WSL terminal), and
type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker --help</code></pre>
<p>You should see the following output:</p>

<h2 id="running-ocaml-in-docker">Running OCaml in Docker</h2>
<p>We will now get OCaml up and running using Docker. First, open a
terminal (Windows the WSL terminal) and move into your course repo.</p>
<pre><code>cd PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO</code></pre>
<p>Then run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker compose build ocamlenv</code></pre>
<p>This builds and sets up the Docker container with OCaml. This may
take some time to complete based on your internet speed and
computer.</p>
<p>Next we can run the container using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker compose run ocamlenv</code></pre>
<p>You should see a prompt similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>104b135fb4b4:/PL#</code></pre>
<p>If we use the list files command <code>ls</code> then we can see the
only files in the container are your homework files. These are the exact
some homework files as the ones in your repo. So you run them using
OCaml in the container, and still edit them using VS Code on your actual
computer.</p>
<p>We can also see that OCaml is installed by moving into a homework
assignment, and running <code>dune</code>:</p>
<pre><code>7a56fd199bb0:/PL# cd hwk/1/
7a56fd199bb0:/PL/hwk/1# ls

<p>If this worked, then you can now complete your homework assignments
for this course.</p>
<h1 id="recommended-work-flow">Recommended work flow</h1>
<p>When completing your homework, I recommend using the following
workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the command line and move into your repository using the
<code>cd</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull all new changes from Github using
<code>git pull</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>sudo docker compose run ocamlenv</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open your repo in VS Code and open the homework assignment you
want to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit some code, and then compile it using <code>dune</code> at
the Docker prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until you are done with the assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Close the Docker container.</p></li>
<li><p>After you are done working commit your changes using
<code>git commit -a -m 'MESSAGE'</code>. Commit after you work every
time no matter if your done with your assignment or not. This keeps your
repository clean.</p></li>
<li><p>After you commit push your changes to Github using
<code>git push</code>. Do this every time you’re done working too. You
can push as many times as you like. Committing and pushing every time
your done working on your assignments keeps Git happy.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob’s your uncle!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all you need to know to complete all the assignments in
this class.</p>
