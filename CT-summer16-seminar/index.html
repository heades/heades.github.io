<h4>Welcome</h4>

This is the home page for the Category Theory Seminar during Summer 2016.  This seminar assumes the attendees have at least a basic understanding of Discrete Mathematics -- have taken CSCI:3030 Mathematical Structures in CS or equivalent -- otherwise it is assumed all attendees have not studied category theory before.  We will attempt to get through as much as possible of the introductory book <a href="http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/Barr-Wells-ctcs.pdf">Category Theory for Computing Sciences (PDF)</a> by Michael Barr and Charles Wells.

<h4>Format</h4>

This will be a weekly seminar which meets every Friday from 2:00pm - 3:30pm EST starting May 27th.  This seminar will be a group effort where all attendees will take turns presenting material to the group by summarizing the material and giving examples.  In addition, we will help each other when trying to understand the more difficult material.  All attendees are required to read the material before the corresponding meeting discussing that material.
