<h1 id="project-proposal">1: Project Proposal</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>You are to propose a <strong>problem</strong> and an
<strong>approach</strong> that could form the basis of a project for
this course. Successful projects will observe the need for good
human-centered design in an interactive computing system, analyze the
needs and opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and
propose a compelling solution.</p>
<h3 id="project-theme">Project Theme</h3>
<p>The theme for projects in this course is <strong>self-tracking and
everyday interaction with personal data</strong>.</p>
<p>People have long sought to better understand themselves, but
continuing technology advances enable new approaches. Students will
examine problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from
personal data, then explore how design insights can help go beyond
simple data fetishes to support people in using personal data as part of
reaching their goals.</p>
<p>Understanding and designing for self-tracking is also known as
personal informatics:</p>
<p>“Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect
personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and
gaining self-knowledge.” by [<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753409">Li et al.,2010</a>]</p>
<p>Self-tracking and personal informatics are related to the <a
href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> movement, which
describes itself as:</p>
<p>“Self-knowledge through numbers.” by [<a
href="https://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself">Wolf,
2010</a>]</p>
<p>Instead of limiting self-tracking to dashboards for an isolated
self-analyst, consider the many different ways people might gather and
interact with personal data, and how they might gain meaningful value
from these activities.</p>
<p>Tracking can therefore take many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>wearable sensors</li>
<li>phone and watch applications</li>
<li>appliances and other artifacts in the environment</li>
<li>hybrid and multi-device forms (e.g., mobile capture with later
annotation or review)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking can include many social contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>people seeking help from peers (e.g., social sharing, support
networks)</li>
<li>people seeking help from experts (e.g., health providers)</li>
<li>co-located relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)</li>
<li>remote relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)</li>
<li>communities organizing (e.g., people in a building, community
volunteers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking can explore new forms of interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>conversational interfaces</li>
<li>tangible interfaces</li>
<li>ubiquitous computing interfaces</li>
<li>artificial intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>Any problem where people gather or seek value in personal data
introduces opportunities and challenges in designing for effective
interaction around that data.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-big">Thinking Big</h3>
<p>Your proposal must go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a
website, phone application, or interaction. Instead think about the
problems that people face in their lives, how we can approach those
problems, and the role for interactive computing. This first assignment
is your opportunity to think broadly about identifying a problem.
Subsequent assignments will provide opportunities to focus on designing
a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.</p>
<p>You should identify and consider goals and activities that are
important to people. Potential domains include:</p>
<ul>
<li>living a healthy life</li>
<li>managing finances effectively</li>
<li>managing time effectively</li>
<li>reducing environmental impact</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities within personal informatics can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>planning to track</li>
<li>helping remember to track</li>
<li>the actual act of tracking</li>
<li>identifying activity patterns</li>
<li>sharing accomplishments with friends and family</li>
<li>deciding to abandon tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging
into your bank account). Instead identify problems in long-lived
activities that span many different social or technological contexts. If
you want to help people manage their money, do not immediately propose a
website that addresses one specific task. Instead consider the range of
other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile devices, shared family
computers, point of sale systems).</p>
<p>Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that
addresses the issues of specific people. Design is rarely for
“everybody”, but instead generally more compelling with a more clear
focus. You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the time
frame of this course, so consider whether you can reasonably gain access
to the necessary people.</p>
<p>We encourage you to think big, expanding your thinking to include new
ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms. Do not feel
constrained by current devices or immediate implementation, but instead
aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially motivate the
development of new enabling technology.</p>
<p>Finally, the project theme requires your proposal present some
opportunity for <strong>self-tracking and everyday interaction with
personal data</strong>. But you will ultimately follow your design
process where it leads you, which may or may not emphasize self-tracking
or personal data. Focusing on problems and opportunities, rather than
specific design features, will leave room for your design to emerge and
be refined in the course of this project.</p>
<h2 id="milestones-and-deliverables">Milestones and Deliverables</h2>
<p>This is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-1.a-ideation-of-potential-projects">Assignment 1.A:
Ideation of potential projects</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to help get you started in thinking of
some ideas for a potential projects.</p>
<p>Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems,
and goals that might be supported via self-tracking.</p>
<p>By domain, we mean an aspect of life. Domains that are already common
in self-tracking include:</p>
<ul>
<li>finances (e.g., tracking spending, a budget, investments)</li>
<li>wellness (e.g., tracking physical activity, sleep, weight)</li>
<li>health (e.g., tracking for post-surgical pain management, allergies
or other personal triggers, major weight loss)</li>
<li>mood (e.g., tracking mood, identifying depressive symptoms)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design
solutions. One way to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and
goals is to ask “Why?”. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is a person using a budgeting app?</li>
<li>Why is a person tracking their spending?</li>
<li>Why do they want to know how much they spend on leisure
activities?</li>
<li>Why do they have a goal of saving for a major purchase?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each idea should be just a sentence or two, identifying the domain
and the problem, goal, or idea.</p>
<p>Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on
the same idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains
above.</li>
<li>Your other two ideas should come from two domains that are not in
the above list and are different from each other.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</p>
<p>Submit via your git repository.</p>
<h4 id="in-class">In Class</h4>
<p>Be prepared to contribute your initial ideas as part of a larger
brainstorm.</p>
<p>Bring a printed copy of your submission, or otherwise have it readily
available (e.g., as a photo on your phone).</p>
<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>3
points</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Each Unique Proposed Idea</strong>: (3 x 1 point)</p>
<p>Do not submit small variations on the same idea.</p>
<p>Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.</p>
<p>Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course
theme.</p>
<p>At most one of your ideas may come from the domains listed above
(i.e., finances, wellness, health, mood).</p>
<p>Be clear regarding the domain of each idea, ensure each idea is from
a different domain.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-1.b-problem-proposal">Assignment 1.B: Problem
Proposal</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems
that could form the basis of a design project for this class.</p>
<p>Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the
course theme and could form the basis of a design project for this
class.</p>
<p>For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and
motivation. This description should convince the reader that this is a
difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new
idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.</p>
<p>Ensure each problem or idea is significantly different, not small
variations on the same problem or idea.</p>
<p>Ensure it is clear why each problem or idea is potentially related to
the course theme.</p>
<p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to
your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short
or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>
<p>After receiving critique on TBA, update your proposals ahead of
additional critique on TBA.</p>
<p>As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique,
your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your
original ideas (e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely
different idea, completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different
perspective).</p>
<h4 id="submission-1">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</p>
<ul>
<li>After receiving critique on TBA, submit an updated version. In the
same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement, also
provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what
you revised, why you revised it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-1">In Class</h4>
<p>Be prepared to discuss your three proposed problems.</p>
<p>Bring several printed copies of your submission, so you can easily
share them with peers for critique.</p>
<h4 id="grading-1">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>10
points</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed
Idea</strong>: (3 x 2 points)</p>
<p>Do not submit small variations on the same idea.</p>
<p>Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.</p>
<p>Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course
theme.</p>
<p>Completely modify at least one idea as part of revision after initial
critique.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Novelty and Creativity</strong>: (2 points)</p>
<p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to

<li><p><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</p>
<p>In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement,
also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on
what you revised, why you revised it).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission, but
may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely
underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-1.c-problem-proposal-and-analysis">Assignment 1.C:
Problem Proposal and Analysis</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that
will form the basis of a design project for this class. You should build
upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff.
Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your
group should have coalesced around an idea.</p>
<p>In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. State
what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and
why it will enhance an existing application or practice. Provide enough
detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting
problem, worth spending a quarter considering.</p>
<p>In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more
background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be
compelling. Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current
situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be
beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from existing systems or
practices could be used to support those claims. If appropriate, you may
conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how
someone might encounter and resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to
your proposed problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short
or suggest how you may explore a different approach.</p>
<h4 id="submission-2">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</p>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="grading-2">Grading</h4>
<p>Submitting a finalized project proposal as part of a group is a

<h1 id="getting-the-right-design">2: Getting the Right Design</h1>
<h2 id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>Even when a problem is well-motivated, understanding that problem and
choosing a design to pursue is a difficult process. This group
assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem
of selecting the right design through <strong>design research</strong>,
<strong>task development</strong>, <strong>generating multiple potential
designs</strong>, and finally <strong>selecting a design</strong> to
pursue.</p>
<h2 id="milestones-and-deliverables-1">Milestones and Deliverables</h2>
<p>This is a group assignment, consisting of eight milestones.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-2.a-planning-design-research">Assignment 2.A:
Planning Design Research</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan
effective design research to inform your design process.</p>
<p>Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects
of your project proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed
(e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or
other artifacts in the environment).</li>
<li>Data: types of data a design might track or help a person
track.</li>
<li>Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.</li>
<li>Features: a specific capability a design might have.</li>
<li>Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a
design might engage or support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide sheets of paper to help structure this brainstorm.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a
quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea. A person familiar
with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the
idea each sketch conveys.</p>
<p>The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not
attempting to polish some individual possibility. Focus on the quantity
of ideas, not the quality of any one idea. You may include ideas from
existing products, but no two ideas should be alike. When you get stuck,
find a context to inspire new ideas.</p>
<p>After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible
directions. Your project will soon need to gather information on how to
generate and consider ideas in such directions. Following up on the
above, additionally brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
<li>People: types of people you might work with to learn more about
problems and opportunities.</li>
<li>Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus
on learning more about.</li>
<li>Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about
problems and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and Grading</h4>
<p>Submit this via your git repo.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-2.b-initial-plan-for-design-research">Assignment 2.B:
Initial plan for design research</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your
design research, encouraging you to work through details of how you
would conduct that research and improving those details through critique
and peer feedback.</p>
<p>As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations) to learn from at
least <strong>three</strong> people who might use your design.</p>
<p>In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design. If
other people are also likely impacted by a design, also describe these
other stakeholders to consider. Among potential stakeholders, describe
the <strong>participants</strong> you plan to pursue, including such
details as their background and the environment where you will examine
their current practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, your target participants should not be “doctors” but
instead a specific group of doctors (e.g., Family Practitioners in the
UW Roosevelt Clinic). Other stakeholders might include patients of the
clinic, nurses in the clinic, or non-medical staff in the clinic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe your <strong>recruitment plan</strong> in enough detail to
convince us that you can find and engage with your target participants
in the next week. Whether you intend to target participants that are
relatively difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors) or more
readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at the Augusta
University), describe your planned recruitment activities, and when you
will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit, and
your plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the
necessary timeline.</p>
<p>In another paragraph, describe the <strong>specific design research
method(s)</strong> you will use to engage with and learn from these
people and your rationale for choosing these method(s). A typical
expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
However, we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design
research methods according to your needs (e.g., you are welcome but not
required to propose to combine multiple methods). Please be as specific
as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you
want to observe and your planned focus.</li>
<li>If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan
to explore.</li>
<li>If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to
ask participants to bring or collect.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed
method. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you
intend to observe, what focus you intend to bring to observation of each
activity, and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight
through your observations.</li>
<li>If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking
points.</li>
<li>If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will
ask participants to diary.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-3">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than two pages of text in PDF format.</p>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-2">In Class</h4>
<p>Be prepared to discuss your design research plan.</p>
<p>Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four), so that
you can easily present them to peers for critique.</p>
<h4 id="grading-3">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>9
points</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Overall Feasibility and Specificity of People and
Recruitment Plan</strong>: (3 points)</p>
<p>Describe stakeholders and participants.</p>
<p>Describe recruitment plan.</p>
<p>Describe any steps already taken and plans to recover if recruitment
is not initially successful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Feasibility and Specificity of Design Research
Methods</strong>: (2 points)</p>
<p>Describe your specific design research method(s) and your rationale
for choosing these method(s).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary Method Details</strong>: (2 points)</p>
<p>Provide sufficient details of your primary method to support critique
of those details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-2.c-starting-your-design-research">Assignment 2.C:
Starting your design research</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research, reflect
on what you observe and learn, then update your plans for additional
design research.</p>
<p>Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this
check-in. You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who
might use your design, but also about effectively conducting your design
research.</p>
<p>Describe your first design research participant and your
findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you do?
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or
context.</li>

2.D: Reflection on your design research</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and
learned in your design research, organizing observations around themes
and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.</p>
<h4 id="identifying-themes">Identifying Themes</h4>
<p>Complete design research with a total of at least three participants.
Discuss your process and what you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you do?
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or
context.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What did you learn?
<ul>
<li>List <strong>at least eight</strong> specific findings based on what
you observed or learned.</li>
<li>For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you
uncover?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We expect findings will be short but concrete. For example, findings
might be organized as a bulleted list, where each bullet starts with a
bolded summary of the finding and then shares a participant quote or
researcher observation that informed that finding.</p>
<p>Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for
relatively few additional findings. We expect you will curate your
findings (e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting, to convey
the range of things you learned, to emphasize key themes you have
identified). Some of your specific findings therefore might also have
been reported in Assignment 2.C, but others will be new and the overall
set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.</p>
<p>Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes,
problems, and practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are
suggested by your findings across multiple participants.</li>
<li>Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are
important to design for?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems,
and design opportunities, it may indicate a need to develop additional
understanding through more design research. Because your findings at
this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project, ensure
your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you
need to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="task-analysis-questions">Task Analysis Questions</h4>
<p>Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the
following questions. These should help you begin to identify tasks
essential to your design.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Who is going to use the design?</li>
<li>What tasks do they now perform?</li>
<li>What tasks are desired?</li>
<li>How are the tasks learned?</li>
<li>Where are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the person and data?</li>
<li>What other tools does the person have?</li>
<li>How do people communicate with each other?</li>
<li>How often are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What are the time constraints on the tasks?</li>
<li>What happens when things go wrong?</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-2.e-task-development">Assignment 2.E: Task
Development</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will
explore in a set of potential designs.</p>
<p>Building on what you learned in your design research, design
<strong>six tasks</strong> that you believe are important to your design
goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how
to accomplish it.</li>
<li>Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are
solving and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.</li>
<li>Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing
tasks (i.e., tasks people already do) as well as your vision for new
tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your potential designs).</li>
<li>These should be real world tasks that include details (e.g., instead
of “programming a DVR”, details like “programming a DVR to record
Spongebob on Sundays”). Such details can then be explored in scenarios
with the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.</li>
<li>Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs
you will develop in later milestones. Although it can be helpful to
describe a task in the context of a specific scenario, the task itself
should be more general and potentially achieved using multiple potential
designs.</li>
<li>Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and
difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each task should be presented as a bolded sentence at the beginning
of a paragraph, concisely conveying a problem and/or what is
accomplished. The remainder of the paragraph should then present
additional details, potential scenarios, or a step-by-step walkthrough
with specific designs.</p>
<p>As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising
your tasks. Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding
of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive. The tasks
you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not
necessarily final.</p>
<h4 id="submission-6">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than two pages of text in PDF format, to include:</p>

<li><strong>Each of 6 Tasks</strong>: (6 x 1 points)</li>
<li><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-2.f-developing-design-ideas">Assignment 2.F:
Developing Design Ideas</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that
address your tasks.</p>
<p>You have identified and described six important tasks for your design
problem. You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different
<strong>initial designs</strong> for your interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not
necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.</li>
<li>Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your
four tasks. A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate
the entire design.</li>
<li>These should be rough sketches (i.e., not digital mockups),
including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing
transitions and relationships).</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before
you lock yourself into a single design. They must demonstrate
significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your
problem.</p>
<p>After receiving critique on TBA, update your designs ahead of
additional critique on TBA.</p>
<h4 id="submission-7">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than three pages of text in PDF format, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from
prior assignment). These should be updated according to feedback and any
evolution in your understanding.</li>
<li>For each of three initial designs:
<ul>
<li>The high-level idea of the design (one paragraph).</li>
<li>Images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups).</li>
<li>How to complete each of the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of
steps, one or two sentences per task).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-6">In Class</h4>

<li><p><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-2.g-design-idea-proposal">Assignment 2.G: Design Idea
Proposal</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in
the remainder of this course.</p>
<p>From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in
the remainder of this course. Then select two tasks that will be the
focus of your design refinement. The selected tasks need to be
representative of the experience of using your design. They should be
non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should emphasize
long-lived or repeated activities. In contrast, a one-time login screen
for a social networking application is not worth being the focus of your
project, does not define your project functionality, and is not
sufficiently interesting.</p>
<p>Prepare one paragraph describing <em>why you selected the design</em>
and <em>why you selected the tasks</em> you did. Draw upon feedback from
critiques and data from your design research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why this design and these tasks?</li>
<li>What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are
targeting your design?</li>
<li>Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks
you chose, and why you chose them.</p>
<p>Then <em>create a storyboard of each task</em> for your selected
design. Storyboards should clearly indicate the functionality of the
design and what it will be like, conveying the major aspects of the
design in enough detail that a person not in your group can understand
how the design supports each task. They should establish motivation and
satisfaction, should show insight into the task and design, and should
include one or more characters and settings. To ensure clarity of your
story, storyboards should not include any unneeded frames or unnecessary
details across multiple frames. As needed, ensure clarity of your story
through captions, other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or
other techniques.</p>
<h4 id="submission-8">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph).</li>
<li>Images of your storyboards and associated captions or
descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-7">In Class</h4>
<p>Be prepared to discuss your chosen design and storyboards.</p>
<p>Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four), so that
you can easily present them to peers for critique.</p>
<h4 id="grading-8">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>8
points</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rationale for Choosing a Design Focus and Tasks</strong>: (2

<li><strong>Each of 2 Storyboards</strong>: (2 x 2 points)</li>
<li><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-2.h-presenting-your-design-research">Assignment 2.H:
Presenting your design research</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
research in a presentation.</p>
<p>Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the right design.
It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every member of your team should deliver the presentation, each
speaking to relatively equal portions.</li>
<li>Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 3, such
that everybody presents at least once this quarter. If there is some
reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated
with us.</li>
<li>A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional
time for questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your presentation should include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Title Slide</strong>:</p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
<p>Include team member names. Be clear which team members are
presenting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a
design investigation.</p>
<p>Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem. Consider
using data or statistics regarding importance of the problem. Consider
using a scenario or story to convey an emotional or human perspective on
the problem. Be sure to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need
to develop a connection to your audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design Research</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey what design research you conducted. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your methods (i.e., what design research did you do).</li>
<li>Your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).</li>
<li>Your key findings (i.e., what key things did you learn that will
inform your design).</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider including images that give your audience a feeling for your
work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>6 Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey the breadth of tasks you have considered, in at most one
sentence per task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3 Design Sketches</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey the breadth of designs you considered.</p>
<p>Be clear what is the key idea or difference in each of your three
designs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selected Design Storyboards and Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your storyboards, ensuring they effectively illustrate your
selected design and tasks.</p>
<p>Convey your rationale for choosing this as a design focus.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand. For
example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving
each other feedback on your presentations.</p>
<p>Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section
of this presentation. You can deliver your presentation using as many or
as few slides as you want, as long as your presentation successfully
addresses the above points in the allowed time.</p>
<h4 id="submission-9">Submission</h4>
<p>Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.</p>
<p>To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a
single laptop running Microsoft Windows. You should optimize your
presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are
embedded). If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the
presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them. But
you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.</p>
<p>Submit your presentation via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="grading-9">Grading</h4>
<p>The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of
<strong>16 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentations should not have an outline slide. They are short
enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the
same as every other presentation. Instead use that time to tell us about
your project.</li>
<li>The problem should be presented in a manner that is compelling and
achievable.</li>
<li>Design research should be carried out and presented in an
appropriate manner. This should include methods, participants, and key
findings.</li>
<li>Tasks should provide coverage of envisioned functionality and be
motivated by the design research.</li>
<li>Design ideas should be distinct and have a connection to results of
design research.</li>
<li>The selected design and task storyboards should be compelling and
have a connection to results of design research.</li>
<li>Presentations should show appropriate preparation, with slides that
are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and
properly employed.</li>
<li>Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of
<strong>4 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.</li>
<li>Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the
room.</li>
<li>Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading
slides.</li>
<li>Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="getting-the-design-right">3: Getting the Design Right</h1>
<h2 id="overview-2">Overview</h2>
<p>Now that you have chosen a design, it is time to iteratively refine
that design. This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the
course, tackles the problem of getting the design right through
<strong>paper prototyping</strong>, <strong>inspection</strong>, and
<strong>usability testing</strong>. Design refinement culminates in a
<strong>digital mockup</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="milestones-and-deliverables-2">Milestones and Deliverables</h2>
<p>This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-3.a-initial-paper-prototype">Assignment 3.A: Initial
Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype
that will begin to allow testing of your design.</p>
<p>Develop a paper prototype for your design. It should convey critical
components of your design, including support for testing your two
primary tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include an overview image that shows your entire paper
prototype.</li>
<li>The prototype should be complete for each task, including enough
detail to show how to complete each step in the task. This should
include the desired / expected / intended path, but also likely error
conditions (e.g., what happens if some participant input is
invalid?).</li>
<li>The prototype should be at an appropriate level of detail,
supporting understanding of critical components of your design and the
context of the your primary tasks.</li>
<li>The documentation in your report should explain how the components
of your prototype are related. This should include detailed images
showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and
storyboarding. But it also contains more details than your prior
exploratory designs. If necessary or appropriate, revise your tasks or
scenarios based on what you learn in prototyping.</p>
<p>If you use an informal drawing tool, you will need to have physical
copies of your paper prototype throughout upcoming milestones. In
addition, you will need to able to provide a PDF version for submission.
You will also need the ability to quickly iterate on your paper
prototype.</p>
<h4 id="submission-10">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>
<li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two
primary tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-8">In Class</h4>
<p>Bring your paper prototype to class. You will need it to conduct a
heuristic evaluation during class.</p>
<h4 id="grading-10">Grading</h4>
<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>10
points</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper
Prototype</strong>: (2 points)</p>
<p>Include an overview image.</p>
<p>Include enough detail to support understanding of critical components
of your design and the context of your primary tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completeness, Appropriateness, and Documentation of Each
Task</strong>: (2 x 3 points)</p>
<p>Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to
complete each step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (2 points)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-3.b-heuristic-evaluations">Assignment 3.B: Heuristic
Evaluations</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to conduct heuristic evaluations as
part of rapidly iterating on your paper prototype.</p>
<p>You will receive an evaluation in class, and you will supplement this
with another evaluation.</p>
<p>In class, pair with another team to conduct heuristic evaluations.
One team will conduct a heuristic evaluation of the other’s paper
prototype, then the two teams will reverse roles. Each team will
therefore conduct and receive one heuristic evaluation.</p>
<p>We will provide a worksheet with <a
href="includes/lectures/3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf">Nielsen’s
heuristics</a></p>
<p>For each issue identified in evaluation, record: - The heuristic that
is violated. - A description of the usability issue, including an image
of the relevant portion of the prototype. - A severity rating (ranging
from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability
catastrophe</em>).</p>
<p>Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic
evaluation. Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them
if your evaluation reveals a need.</p>
<p>Outside of class, arrange to receive a second heuristic evaluation
(e.g., with another team). You therefore received two heuristic
evaluations of your paper prototype. If desired, you may also conduct a
heuristic evaluation or cognitive walkthrough of your own paper
prototype.</p>
<h4 id="submission-and-grading-1">Submission and Grading</h4>
<p>Records of your inspection-based methods will be submitted as part of
later assignments (eg., see Assignment 3c).</p>
<p>Be sure to keep detailed records, including images of relevant
portions of the prototype before and after revisions.</p>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h3
id="assignment-3.c-changes-based-on-inspection-based-analyses">Assignment
3.C: Changes based on inspection-based analyses</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to document changes resulting from your
inspection-based analyses and to begin usability testing of your revised
prototype with participants.</p>
<p>Complete one usability test with your paper prototype, examining your
two primary tasks.</p>
<p>Target an appropriate participant based on your design research and
resulting design.</p>
<p>Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting a usability
test. There is simply too much required for a single person to
effectively conduct a test. As discussed in class, roles include the
facilitator, the computer, and one or more observers.</p>
<p>As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the
participant how to interact with your design. Do not show participants
how to perform your tasks that you will later test. Instead show them
how paper prototyping works, how your system generally works, and give
an example of something specific that is sufficiently different from
your tasks.</p>
<p>During the test, record a log of critical incidents, including both
positive and negative events. For example, a person might comment on
something they like or might make a mistake in a task. Record the
incident along with a description of the context of the incident.</p>
<p>Consider recording your tests to allow you to see and show exactly
what happened. If you do this, obtain permission from the participant
and ensure your recording preserves the anonymity of the participant.
Frame your shot such that you capture interaction with the prototype
without unnecessarily capturing the participant.</p>
<p>Each participant should perform both of your primary tasks. Keep the
data separate for each participant and each task. Remember participation
must be voluntary, participants should be free to stop at any time, and
you should emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues
in the design.</p>
<p>Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability
testing. This can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they
are detected, before additional tests. Your tasks and scenarios are
likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.</p>
<p>Present your iterative revisions and your plan going forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present a table or list of results from your inspection-based
methods. We expect you will report at least <strong>four</strong>
identified issues and resulting revisions, which may be small or large.
You may report more, but this is the expected minimum. For each
identified issue, include:
<ul>
<li>The heuristic that is violated.</li>
<li>A description of the usability issue, including an image of the
relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
<li>A severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no problem</em> to 4 for
<em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
<li>An image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result. If
you highlight an issue without revising in response to it, provide
explanation of that decision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discuss your first usability test.
<ul>
<li>Provide a description of your testing method and participant (e.g.,
the participant, the environment where you conducted the test, why you
chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles
of each team member who participated in the test).</li>
<li>Discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself. This
should include at least one part of your method that was especially
effective or one revision you decided you need to make to your testing
process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Present a table or list of results from your first usability test.
We expect you will report at least <strong>two</strong> identified
incidents, which may be small or large. You may report more, but this is
the expected minimum. For each critical incident, include:
<ul>
<li>An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
<li>Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either
positive or negative.</li>
<li>For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no
problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
<li>For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision
implemented as a result.</li>
<li>For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this
incident.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised
in this process. Your design may have changed more or less, so this is
intended to fully convey the current state of your design. As before,
ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail,
and documents each task. Include both:
<ul>
<li>An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>
<li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two
primary tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Present your plan for the remainder of your usability tests.
Describe what goals you have for the additional tests and any new
approaches you will employ. You will conduct one usability test in
section, describe your plans for recruiting an additional
participant.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of
your design, you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the
overhead of documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation
are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough
insight to understand your progress.</li>
<li>Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web
content and presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to
document enough for these two goals.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-3.d-usability-testing">Assignment 3.D: Usability
Testing</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to complete usability testing of your
prototype with participants.</p>
<p>Complete a total of at least three usability tests and finalize your
paper prototype according to what you learn.</p>
<p>Present the results of your usability testing and your final paper
prototype:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discuss your three usability tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a description of your testing method and participant (e.g.,
the participant, the environment where you conducted the test, why you
chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles
of each team member who participated in the test).</li>
<li>Briefly discuss anything you learned about the testing process
itself. This should include at least one part of your method that was
especially effective or one revision you decided to make to your testing
process.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Present a table or list of results from your three usability
tests. We expect you will report at least <strong>three</strong>
identified incidents, which may be small or large. You may report more,
but this is the expected minimum. This may include incidents you
previously reported from your first usability test, but may also be
completely different in order to focus on the most important incidents
you want to report. For each critical incident, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.</li>
<li>Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either
positive or negative.</li>
<li>For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for <em>no
problem</em> to 4 for <em>usability catastrophe</em>).</li>
<li>For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision
implemented as a result.</li>
<li>For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this
incident.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised
in this process. Your design may have changed more or less, so this is
intended to fully convey the current state of your design. As before,
ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail,
and documents each task. Include both:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.</li>
<li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two
primary tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be your most
salient and important modifications based on issues identified in
inspection, usability testing, or critique. These may already be
included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue
why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss at least one revision you made to promote inclusivity in
your design. Describe an unintentional assumption you identified in your
design, then describe how you revised your design to address this
assumption. If you are unable to identify this before this submission is
due, you may discuss this more in section and submit a revised
assignment adding this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of
your design, you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the
overhead of documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation
are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough
insight to understand your progress.</li>
<li>Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web
content and presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to
document enough for these two goals.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-3.e-digital-mockup">Assignment 3.E: Digital
Mockup</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to transition your prototype into a
digital mockup of your design.</p>
<p>Create your digital mockup based on your final paper prototype. Do
not begin working in digital prototyping until you finish revising your
paper prototype. It is much easier to iterate on your design in the
paper prototyping phase.</p>
<p>As you transition into digital prototyping, you will need to consider
other aspects of the design. This can include detail you may not have
previously considered (e.g., visual design, layout, color, typography),
but can also include constraints or mismatches introduced by the
technology itself. Note decisions or changes you need to make as you
transition from paper to a digital representation.</p>
<p>The mockup should effectively communicate your design in a manner
appropriate for your web content, presentation, and poster. Implement
your digital mockup to include key frames that illustrate your design.
It should convey all critical aspects of your design, including
walkthroughs for your two primary tasks.</p>
<p>We have no strong preference regarding what digital tools you use to
create your mockup. But it must be digital (e.g., you may not use
pictures of a hand-drawn sketch). Some tools support creation of
interactive mockups (e.g., allow clicking active regions to move between
screens). You are welcome to use such a tool, and such interactivity may
be helpful. But interactive mockups are neither expected nor
required.</p>
<p>Figma is a widely-used web-based collaborative tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a></li>

<li><a href="https://vectr.com/">Vectr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Present your digital mockup together with discussion of the decisions
and changes you made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit detailed images of your digital mockup. Include both:
<ul>
<li>Overview images that show your digital mockup.</li>
<li>Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two
primary tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discuss decisions and changes you made in implementing the digital
mockup.
<ul>
<li>We expect you will report at least <strong>three</strong> decisions
or changes you made, which may be small or large. You may report more,
but this is the expected minimum.</li>
<li>Describe each decision or change in a few sentences, including why
the change was necessary or desired. Include images to be sure it is
easy to understand the decision or change.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of
your design, you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the
overhead of documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation
are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough
insight to understand your progress.</li>
<li>Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web
content and presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to
document enough for these two goals.</p>
<h4 id="submission-13">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than one page of text in PDF format.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-3.f-presenting-your-design-prototype">Assignment 3.F:
Presenting your design prototype</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
prototyping in a presentation.</p>
<p>Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the design right.
It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each
speaking to relatively equal portions.</li>
<li>Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 2, such
that everybody presents at least once this quarter. If there is some
reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated
with us.</li>
<li>A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional
time for questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A suggested organization of this presentation is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Title Slide</strong>:</p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
<p>Include team member names. Be clear which team members are
presenting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a
design investigation.</p>
<p>Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem and your
proposed solution. Remember that you are teaching us what you learned in
your process, you are not “selling” your solution. Be sure to avoid
simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to
your audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initial Paper Prototype</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your initial paper prototype. Convey the critical aspects of
your design, including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper
prototype.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing Process</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your process for iteratively improving your design,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>your methods (i.e., what methods did you use to improve your initial
design),</li>
<li>your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</strong>:</p>
<p>Present usability and design issues that you identified and iterative
improvements you made to address those issues. This will include changes
from your heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and design
critique.</p>
<p>Discuss identified issues as an appropriate level of detail,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>specific usability issues that were identified and corrected (e.g.,
consider before and after comparisons),</li>
<li>higher-level findings and themes that emerged (e.g., consider
explaining a specific issue that was identified and how it led to a
larger revision of the design).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Paper Prototype</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your final paper prototype. Convey the critical aspects of
your design, including the two primary tasks. This might be shorter than
your presentation of the initial paper prototype, because you already
presented changes and are about to present the digital mockup. This
might also have been part of your testing process and results, if
changes were illustrated there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Mockup</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your digital mockup. Convey the critical aspects of your
design, including the two primary tasks. Discuss any significant changes
that were required when transitioning from a paper prototype.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand. For
example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving
each other feedback on your presentations.</p>
<p>Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section
of this presentation. You can deliver your presentation using as many or
as few slides as you want, as long as your presentation successfully
addresses the above points in the allowed time.</p>
<h4 id="submission-14">Submission</h4>
<p>Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.</p>
<p>To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a
single laptop running Microsoft Windows. You should optimize your
presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are
embedded). If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the
presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them. But
you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.</p>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="grading-14">Grading</h4>
<p>The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of
<strong>16 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentations should not have an outline slide. They are short
enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the
same as every other presentation. Instead use that time to tell us about
your project.</li>
<li>The problem and your proposed solution should be presented in a
manner that is compelling, should teach us what you learned in your
process rather than “selling” your solution.</li>
<li>The initial prototype should be effectively conveyed through two
scenarios.</li>
<li>The process of iteratively improving the design should be
effectively conveyed and appropriate for the design.</li>
<li>Findings and iterative improvements of the design should be
effectively conveyed.</li>
<li>The final design, as represented by your digital mockup, should be
effectively conveyed through two scenarios.</li>
<li>Presentations should show appropriate preparation, with slides that
are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and
properly employed.</li>
<li>Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of
<strong>4 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.</li>
<li>Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the
room.</li>
<li>Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading
slides.</li>
<li>Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="assignment-4-communicating-your-design">Assignment 4:
Communicating Your Design</h1>
<h2 id="overview-3">Overview</h2>
<p>You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a
promising design, and iterated on that design. It is now time to focus
on communicating your design and your design process. This group
assignment communicates your design through a <strong>web post</strong>
and through a <strong>poster</strong> with an associated
<strong>pitch</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="milestones-and-deliverables-3">Milestones and Deliverables</h2>
<p>This is a group assignment, consisting of five milestones.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-4.a-web-portfolio">Assignment 4.A: Web Portfolio</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
and your underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web
portfolio.</p>
<p>Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design
and then getting the design right. Your prior milestones provide
significant content you can draw upon in this post, but this post is
intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all content from prior milestones will be included, you should
update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design
process (e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard for clarity in
this communication), and you will ultimately emphasize a few key
insights that most informed your design.</p>
<p>Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with
appropriate contrast). Re-make images as necessary to ensure this (e.g.,
by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner, by
re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a
better image).</p>
<p>Remember that audience is important in storytelling, and be sure your
post takes a tone of “presenting” and “reflecting” on your project. You
are not “selling” the resulting design, but are instead “sharing” your
work with an interested audience. You can express enthusiasm, but do not
let that enthusiasm undermine the substance of your content.</p>
<p>Your post should follow the outline below. It will be authored using
Markdown and provided components for including images. Be sure to
inspect and understand the template text provided in your project
directory.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Title and Logo</strong></p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
<p>An attractive project logo. It will be used to link to your project
from the main projects page.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem and Design Overview</strong>:</p>
<p>Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a
brief introduction of your design.</p>
<p>This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs. You should
likely include an image to help build interest. Your goal is to set a
context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about
your work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design Research Process and Key Insights</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Design Research Process</em></p>
<p>First provide a concise overview of your design research process in
Assignment 2, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary
need for additional understanding).</li>
<li>The methods and participants you engaged in your design
research.</li>
<li>Your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and
participants).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process
revealed.</p>
<p>This might be a single paragraph.</p>
<p><em>3 Key Insights</em></p>
<p>Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in
Assignment 2. Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your
design and how each insight is based in your design process.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged (e.g., how your
understanding was shaped by design research, how your understanding was
shaped by critique or feedback).</li>
<li>Use specific evidence whenever possible (e.g., quotes or stories
from participants, pictures captured during observations, pivots in your
approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback, key
reasons you chose one design over alternatives, key reasons you combined
ideas from multiple design alternatives).</li>
<li>Do not number your insights (e.g., “Insight 1”, “Insight 2”,
“Insight 3”). Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., “Minimizing
Burden”, “Creating Social Connections”) or consider that each paragraph
could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.</li>
<li>Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images
from your design sketches or storyboards).</li>
</ul>
<p>These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive
heading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative Design Process and Key Insights</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Iterative Design Process</em></p>
<p>First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in
Assignment 3, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative
design).</li>
<li>Your process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability
testing, and digital mockup).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process
revealed.</p>
<p>This might be a single paragraph. You should likely include an
overview image of your paper prototype.</p>
<p><em>3 Key Insights</em></p>
<p>Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in
Assignment 3. Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your
design and how each insight is based in your design process.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged (e.g., the state
of a design element prior to the insight, the activity, observation,
critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design
element, an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required
re-working your design) and how you iterated upon the design in result
(e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).</li>
<li>Use specific evidence whenever possible (e.g., quotes from or
observations of participants).</li>
<li>Do not number your insights (e.g., “Insight 1”, “Insight 2”,
“Insight 3”). Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., “Simplifying
Data Collection”, “Improving Legibility”, “Removing Gender Assumptions”)
or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded
sentence summarizing the insight.</li>
<li>Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images
from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).</li>
</ul>
<p>These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive
heading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resulting Design</strong>:</p>
<p>Present key elements of your final design. Convey the critical
aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks demonstrated in
your digital mockup (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with
images from your digital mockup).</p>
<p>This section may primarily be a set of images, but be sure you
organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the
resulting design.</p></li>

</ol>
<h3 id="assignment-4.c-poster-pitch">Assignment 4.C: Poster Pitch</h3>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that
communicate your design to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Create a poster that communicates your design and your design
process. Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its
most important aspects. Your poster should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Title</li>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Your Names</li>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Value Proposition</li>
<li>Key Functionality</li>
<li>Key Design Insights</li>
</ul>
<p>Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of
text. For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32”x40” (i.e.,
portrait, vertical).</p>
<p>The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting
point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="includes/lectures/poster-template-a-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint
Template A</a></li>
<li><a href="includes/lectures/poster-template-b-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint
Template B</a></li>
<li><a href="includes/lectures/poster-template-c-32x40.pptx">Powerpoint
Template C</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent
your project.</p>
<p>Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with
appropriate contrast). Re-make images as necessary to ensure this (e.g.,
by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner, by
re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a
better image).</p>
<p>During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute
pitch to a small group of judges. Create a pitch that summarizes the
problem and your design. This pitch should convince an audience that
your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a
compelling direction.</p>
<h4 id="submission-17">Submission</h4>
<p>Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PDF of your poster.</li>
<li>The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file, a text file
containing a Figma link with edit access).</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>
<h4 id="in-class-11">In Class</h4>
<p>We will bring 8.5”x11” printed copies of your poster to class. You
will need these for in-class critique and refinement.</p>
<h4 id="grading-17">Grading</h4>
<p>Your poster should be complete for critique and feedback, but only
the final version will be graded. Note that grading of the final poster
does allocate points to your sufficient preparation for critique and
feedback.</p>
<p>Critique and refinement will help further improve your poster before
a final version.</p>
<h4 id="samples-of-prior-submissions">Samples of Prior Submissions</h4>
<h3 id="assignment-4.d-poster-revisions">Assignment 4.D: Poster
Revisions</h3>
<p>Appropriately revise your poster according to critique and
feedback.</p>
<p>If you are unsure what revisions are appropriate, communicate with
the course staff well before the final poster is due.</p>
<p>During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute
pitch to a small group of judges. Rehearse a pitch that summarizes the
problem and your design. This pitch should convince an audience that
your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a
compelling direction.</p>
<h4 id="submission-18">Submission</h4>
<p>Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PDF of your poster.</li>
<li>The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file, a text file
containing a Figma link with edit access).</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit via your git repo.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-4.e-workshop">Assignment 4.E: Workshop</h3>
<p>Come to the workshop to show off your work and engage with your
classmates. Present your pitch to a team of judges, and take the
opportunity to discuss your work with classmates and visitors while
reflecting on a busy and productive quarter.</p>
<h4 id="grading-19">Grading</h4>

itself.</p>
