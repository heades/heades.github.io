digit projects that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Useable: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Safety, Utility, Learnability,
Memorability</li>
</ul>
<p>and have a well designed:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Experience: Satisfying, Enjoyable, Fun, Entertaining,
Helpful</li>

only time Slack should not be used is when discussing grades. I will not
respond to questions via email unless they are grade specific.</p>
<p>Slack Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>No inappropriate messages will be tolerated.</li>
<li>You must add your fullname (First and Last) to your profile.</li>
<li>All course announcements will be shared in <a
href="SLACK%20LINK">#announcements</a>.</li>
<li>Course discussion will take place in the channel <a
href="SLACK%20LINK">#office_hours</a>.</li>
<li>For fun I’ve created <a href="SLACK%20LINK">#random</a> for sharing
all the gifs and memes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.</p>
<h2 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h2>
<p>Professors like students have many duties and commitments, and so to
be better prepared to help the students outside of class I have the
following office rules that must be adhered to:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a student needs help, and the question is small – takes at most
five minutes to answer – then the student may visit my office at any
time, but</li>
<li>if the question takes longer than five minutes, then the student is
required to make an appointment by slack, or attend office hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a student comes to my office unannounced and the question takes
longer than five minutes, then that student will be instructed to make
an appointment or to come back during office hours.</p>
<p>Appointments are to be scheduled via slack and must contain the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The students name,</li>
<li>a brief description of what the problem is, and</li>
<li>a time the student would like to meet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaboration is important in all areas of study. So I recommend
talking to other students for help. However, there is a rule that must
be followed: <strong>while discussing homework solutions in a group of
two or more no one is allowed to write anything down, and each student
must prepare their solution in isolation</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="augusta-university-policies">AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY POLICIES</h2>
<p>The Augusta University faculty and administration believe that, for
students to be prepared for career success, it is important for them not
only to know the subject matter in their majors, but also to demonstrate
professional, ethical, and responsible business and social behavior.
Whether a person is interviewing for a job, participating in a business
or academic social event, or attending class, there are some important
characteristics of personal behavior that are expected by colleagues and
administrators. In the business work environment, employees can be
dismissed for behavior that is distracting or disruptive to other
employees, customers, or administrators.</p>
<h3 id="class-attendance">Class Attendance</h3>
<p>If the student has been absent for more than the equivalent of 10
percent of class time, regardless of cause, then the professor may
withdraw the student from the class for excessive absences. It is
important to note that the instructor may—or may not—withdraw a student
from class based upon attendance. In any case, a student should not
assume that the instructor has initiated the withdrawal form. A student
not withdrawn from a course who stops attending class (or who never
attends class) is subject to receiving a grade of WF or F for the
course. Please reference the Class Attendance section of the Augusta
University Student Manual for further details.</p>
<p>Each student is expected to attend class regularly, to arrive on
time, and to remain until class is dismissed. Tardiness and leaving
class early are disruptive for other students and the faculty and are
behaviors that are not acceptable in a classroom or business setting.
Students who do not arrive promptly or leave early may be noted as
absent, at the faculty member’s discretion. Absences in excess of the
maximum prescribed in the course syllabus may result in the faculty
member’s withdrawing the student from the course.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>Please review the Student Code of Conduct in the Augusta University
Student Manual. It outlines your responsibilities as students and those
of a faculty member to maintain the integrity of the learning
environment. As outlined in the handbook, disorderly or distracting
conduct may result in expulsion from the class. Moreover, any form of
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Should you be caught cheating
or plagiarizing the work of another the procedures as outlined in the
handbook and catalog will be followed.</p>
<p>The classroom should be considered a place of business - academic
business. Distracting behavior such as uninvited casual talk among
students, use of cell phones and beepers, sleeping, or inappropriate
behavior toward fellow students or faculty will not be tolerated any
more than they would be in a business setting. Faculty have the right
and the responsibility to maintain a classroom free of such
distractions. Students who persist in such behavior may be asked to
leave the class and may be counted absent for the session. Persistent
disruptive behavior may result in the faculty member’s withdrawing the
student from the course.</p>
<h3 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h3>
<p>Students with disabilities must contact the Office of Testing and
Disability Services (706-737-1469) before the start of the semester. If
you require special accommodation, the office will send a classroom
accommodation form to affected faculty. Should you require special
accommodations, please contact me at the beginning of the semester to
determine how they will be implemented. Please reference the Testing and
Disability Services section of the Augusta University Student Manual for
further details.</p>
<h3 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>In an academic community, honesty and integrity must prevail if the
work done and the honors awarded are to receive their respect. The
erosion of honesty is the academic community’s ultimate loss. The
responsibility for the practice and preservation of honesty must be
equally assumed by all of its members. Any type of dishonesty in
securing those credentials therefore invites serious sanctions, up to
and including, a WF in the course, and expulsion from the institution.
Examples of dishonesty include actual or attempted cheating, plagiarism,
or knowingly furnishing false information to any university employee.
Please reference the Academic Honesty section of the Augusta University
Student Manual for further details and specific definitions of cheating
and plagiarism.</p>
<p>Unethical behavior of students in any form is not acceptable and will
not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty (see definitions in the following
sections) - cheating on exams, plagiarism of the work of others,
unapproved collaboration on graded work, and the like - will be dealt
with immediately and with clear consequences. Depending on the nature
and severity of the problem, a student who is guilty of any such
violation may be: 1) withdrawn from the course with a grade of WF
(counted as an F in the GPA); 2) given a grade of zero on the
assignment; 3) given a grade of F in the course; or 4) otherwise
penalized, at the discretion of the faculty member. Two occurrences of a
WF grade for academic dishonesty will result in a student’s being
expelled from the University, per current University policy as described
in the University Catalog.</p>
<h3 id="student-appeals-and-grievances">Student Appeals and
Grievances</h3>
<p>Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly
under these guidelines should first address the matter with the faculty
member responsible for the class. If the problem is not resolved, the
student may meet with the Dean or follow procedures outlined in the
Academic Grievance Policy section of the Augusta University Student
Manual.</p>
<h3 id="campus-carry-law">Campus Carry Law</h3>
<p>The USG guidance on House Bill 280, commonly known as the “campus
carry” legislation, effective as of July 1, 2017 – <a
href="http://www.usg.edu/hb280"
class="uri">http://www.usg.edu/hb280</a>,</p>
<h3 id="academic-dishonesty-definitions">ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
DEFINITIONS</h3>
<p>Any attempt to present intentionally the work or knowledge of others
as your own on a graded test or assignment constitutes academic
dishonesty. The following illustrations do not include every possible
variation of academic dishonesty, but they are examples of the kinds of
infractions that will be considered academic dishonesty violations. If
you have questions about academic dishonesty, please ask any faculty
member or any administrator in the School of Computer and Cyber
Sciences. It is your responsibility to recognize and avoid initiating or
contributing to academically dishonest behavior.</p>
<h3 id="cheating-on-a-test-exam-or-assignment">CHEATING ON A TEST, EXAM,
OR ASSIGNMENT</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Closed-book, closed-notes tests.</strong> The use of any
materials except those provided by the faculty member or provided for in
test instructions is considered cheating. The use of prepared notes,
electronic aids, assistance from others, or the use of any information
obtained from others (with or without their permission) during the test
is considered cheating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open-book, open-notes tests</strong>. Assistance from
others or the use of any information obtained from others (with or
without their permission) during the test, without the permission of the
instructor, is considered cheating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent projects or papers</strong>. If the faculty
member’s instructions require independent, unassisted work on a project
or paper, no portion of the assignment may be prepared by anyone else.
Having any part of the assignment prepared by someone else, or in
collaboration with someone else, is considered cheating unless the
instructor’s instructions specifically call for such
collaboration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assisting others with test information</strong>. Because
many courses are taught at multiple times, it is important that students
in one section of a course not provide information about a test to any
student in another section who will take the same or a similar test at a
later time. To do so will be considered cheating.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plagiarism">PLAGIARISM</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Failure to give credit to others</strong>. On individual
and group assignments – projects, papers, presentations, research
studies, and the like – no portion of the work may contain quotations of
or paraphrasing (rewording) of the work of others unless each such
reference is clearly identified with an appropriate footnote or
bibliographical reference to the original source and author. To not give
credit to others in each such instance is to present the work of others
as if you had written it yourself. That is considered plagiarism. Style
manuals (such as the American Psychological Association manual) provide
guidelines for footnoting, quotations, and other means of giving credit
for the work of others. Your instructor may prefer some particular
style. If no guidelines are provided, it is your responsibility to use a
standard style or ask the faculty member for guidance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ghost writing</strong>. It should go without saying that
having someone else write some or all of a paper or do a project for
which you are individually responsible constitutes academic dishonesty.
Whether the author is a friend, a paid writer, or a person who offers
such services on a web site, the result is an intention to present
someone else’s work as your own and will be treated as an academic
dishonesty infraction.</p></li>
